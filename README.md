Boilerplate for Latex-reports

## How to get started 
Simply download it, then do the following to make sure it can compile before you add anything:

1. Add an image with signatures as `figs/Signatures.png`, or remove the singatures-part of `abstract.tex`
2. Open `frontpage.tex` and change relevant information
3. Remove the content of `glossary.tex`, `bibliography.tex` and `acronyms.tex`, if you don't want what's there. You can commment it out if you want it for reference.
4. Remove example appendix-include in `appendices/appendix-main.tex`.
5. Go through `config/style.sty` and see if you want to change anything.
6. Compile and have fun!
